# MasterThesisCodes
Collection of Scripts I wrote in Java during the creation of my Master Thesis.
These scripts were necessary for the transformation of CityGML-Files describing Singapore in LOD1 for the use inside Simstadt (simstadt.eu). 

I learned that I should buy myself a Macbook and switch to Python for such scripting-tasks ðŸ˜‰
